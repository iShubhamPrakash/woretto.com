**2. Problem Definition: Why Woretto is Needed**

**2.1 The Pain Point of Manual Expense Tracking:**

Current expense tracking applications often fall short because of their reliance on manual data entry. This manual process is:

* **Time-Consuming:**  Users must manually input each transaction, which can be tedious and discouraging, especially with numerous daily expenses.
* **Error-Prone:**  Manual data entry is susceptible to human errors, leading to inaccurate tracking and flawed financial insights.
* **Inconsistent:**  Due to the effort required, many users start tracking expenses enthusiastically but eventually abandon the practice, resulting in incomplete financial records.
* **Boring and Demotivating:**  The repetitive nature of manual data entry makes expense tracking feel like a chore, rather than an empowering tool.

**2.2 Consequences of Ineffective Expense Tracking:**

The inability to effectively track expenses leads to several negative consequences:

* **Lack of Financial Awareness:**  Individuals are often unaware of where their money is actually going, making it difficult to identify unnecessary spending and optimize savings.
* **Difficulty in Budgeting:**  Without a clear understanding of spending patterns, creating and adhering to a budget becomes challenging.
* **Missed Savings Opportunities:**  Unidentified spending leaks prevent users from capitalizing on potential savings and investment opportunities.
* **Financial Stress:**  Lack of control over finances can contribute to stress and anxiety about money management.
* **Inability to Achieve Financial Goals:**  Without proper expense management, achieving long-term financial goals (like buying a house, retirement planning, etc.) becomes significantly harder.
